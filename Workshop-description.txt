[h1]Playable Navigator[/h1]
Makes the Naviagor Origin pickeable for your Rogue Trader at Game Start.
This might also enable you to recruit multiple Navigator mercenaries.

[h2]Usage[/h2]
To use:
[olist]
[*][b]Before you start the character creation:[/b] Click the button in the Playable Navigator mod section of the UnityModManager GUI.
[*]Turn the "Create Navigator" toggle on.

[*]After finishing the character creation don't forget to turn the toggle back off.
[/olist]

[h2]Additional Information[/h2]
[list]
[*]Because the Navigator Origin doesn't have any Darkest Hours and Moments of Triumph I've unlocked all of them for the Navigator.
[*]I know that Navigator get a Custom Portrait. I've left the Portrait Choices by default since variety is way higher that way. If you want the Navigator one you can just export that one using ToyBox and import it as a Custom Portrait.
